# PasswordGeneration


In this program, the user will be able to press a button to generate a password in the console. This was accomplished by using a function that is activated once the button is activated. The function consists of a for loop (I = 0; I < 8, i++) and a string containing every letter and special character on an average keyboard. By using the charAt method in combination with Math.random, we are able to receive a string of up to 8 characters that will make up our password. For user friendliness, an alert is also activated that will instruct them to check the console for their new password.
